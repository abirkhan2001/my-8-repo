            <h2>Personal Branding</h2>
            <p>
                When students build their unique brands, 
                they’re not only marketing their skills, 
                achievements, and strengths, but also their personality,
                 values, and passions. Their brand is conveyed in person – by appearance,
                communication style, and behaviour; on paper – through the application process and online 
                 through social media, blogging platforms, and discussion forums.
                The way students are perceived online is referred to as digital personal brand.
